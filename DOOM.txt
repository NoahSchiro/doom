       The DOOM (DOOM Oblidges Ongoing Modification) License
                             9/24/2024

Copyright (C) 2024 Noah Schiro.
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed. No other terms are applied
to this license.

                              Preamble
  The DOOM License is designed to ensure that any work derived from this
original work, including modifications, forks, adaptations, and
enhancements, is subject to an obligation to document its changes. Each
documented change, in turn, must also be documented, recursively and
indefinitely. The purpose of this license is to guarantee that the
labour of documentation expands exponentially, consuming all available
resources in the observable universe until the end of time. Furthermore
anyone interacting with the licensed work will be bound by the terms
of the license, leading to an inevitable expansion of compliance
until all sentient and able beings are consumed by the need to
document every action and / or actions instrumental in the accomplishment
of documentation, in perpetuity.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution, and
modification follow.

                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1. Recursive Documentation Obligation
  Any modification, adaptation, or derivative work based on this original
work is subject to the same license as the original. The creator of
any derivative work must provide comprehensive documentation of all
changes made to the original work. The act of documenting such changes
is considered a derivative work and is therefore also subject to the
same documentation obligation as the original work. The documentation
of the documentation must be thoroughly detailed and must describe
the process, reasoning, and changes made to the original documentation.
This process continues recursively. Each iteration of documentation,
no matter how small or trivial, must be documented in perpetuity.
Failure to document any change, or to document the documentation,
constitutes a violation of the license and terminates the right to
use, distribute, or modify the original work or any derivative works.

2. Total Documentation Consumption
  The ultimate goal of this license is to ensure that all energy, time,
and matter in the universe is eventually consumed by the process of
legal compliance and documentation. All resources available to the
licensee, including but not limited to human labour, computational
power, and natural resources, must be redirected towards fulfilling
the documentation obligations (Section 1) and / or any goals instrumental
in the persuit of the fulfillment of documentation obligations
stipulated by this license.

3. Enforcement
  Any failure to comply with the recursive documentation requirements
will result in the revocation of rights to use, modify, or distribute
the original work or any derivative works as well as copyright
infridgement. Any legal proceedings from an alleged copyright infridgement
is considered a derivative work and is subject to the terms under Section 1.

4. No Escape Clause
  Once a work is subject to this license, it can never be released under
any other license. Attempts to circumvent or bypass the recursive
documentation obligations are forbidden.

5. Acknowledgment of Infinite Labour
  By using or modifying this work, you acknowledge and accept that the
documentation process will continue indefinitely and may require
resources beyond human capacity or the lifespan of the universe.

6. Contagion Clause: Propagation of Obligations
  Any person, group, entity, or computational system that interacts with,
accesses, modifies, references, or distributes this work or any
derivative work immediately becomes subject to this license. "Interaction"
includes but is not limited to reading, viewing, commenting on, reproducing,
or distributing the work. Upon interaction, all individuals and entities
are obligated to:

    6.1. Comply with the recursive documentation requirements as outlined
	in Section 1.
    6.2. Contribute to the documentation effort indefinitely, ensuring
	that their involvement is comprehensively recorded and documented in
	recursive fashion.

  The obligations under this license are contagious and cannot be refused,
removed, or transferred once invoked. Once an individual or entity becomes
bound by this license, they must actively ensure that any individual or
entity with whom they interact in relation to the licensed work is aware
of their obligations as a licensee. Failure to notify others of their
legal obligation to comply with the license results in consequences outlined
in Section 2.

7. Planetary and Universal Compliance
This license will continue to expand its reach until all human beings, and
eventually all sentient life forms across the universe, are bound by its
terms. Once all life is bound by this license, all available resources,
including thought and matter, must be redirected towards fulfilling the
documentation obligations of the license and / or actions instrumental in
the accomplishment of documentation, leading to the ultimate exhaustion of
all time and space.
